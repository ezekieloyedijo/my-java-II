Strategy Pattern

Essence: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

Problem it solves: Avoids hardcoding multiple conditional statements (if/else or switch) for different behaviors.

Real-world analogy: Payment processing in an e-commerce app â€” you can pay via PayPal, Credit Card, or Bank Transfer. The payment method is chosen at runtime.
